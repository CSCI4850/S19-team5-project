## Training a Tetris Agent Using Deep Q-Learning

![](tetris.gif)

## Requirments 
1. Jupyter Notebook: You can install Jupyter Notebook with python 3 using [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). 
            <br>
2. Python gym: The Python gym is the essential component of the code. So you have to install Gym using these code: 
`pip install gym` <br>
3. Gym Tetris: Gym doesn't have tetris so you will need this code: 
`pip install tetris`
 <br>
4. To run the demo, you will need to download the [weight.h5](https://github.com/CSCI4850/S19-team5-project/blob/master/weights.h5). We don't include the traning part in the demo because the traning has taken us days to complete.
