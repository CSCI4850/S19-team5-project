The paper is in its initial stages with the intro/background done but a little less was accomplished than anticipated. The team still believes we can reach 100% by the completion date.\n",

The final touches on the code will be completed by Puran and Daniel with David and Yousaf acting as secondary input (reviewal/training). We hope to have the paper completed by the next milestone with David acting as primary, Yousaf as secondary, and Puran/Daniel as reviewers. We will all be contributing towards the demo which we hope to just get a 75% done by the next milestone. Yousaf will be acting as primary for the presentation (preparing slides, doing the 5 minute intro, delegating/organizing the rest of the presentation) with the rest of the group acting as secondary. 75% of the presentation is expected to be complete by the next milestone.
